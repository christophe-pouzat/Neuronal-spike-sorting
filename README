This project is dedicated to spike sorting code developments. The illustration of code use on publicly available data sets is considered an integral part of the project. The main langages used for developments are going to be R (http://www.r-project.org) and Common Lisp. The illustrations are going to be generated with the Babel extension (http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/) of emacs' (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) org-mode (http://orgmode.org).
