This project is dedicated to spike sorting code developments. The illustration of code use on publicly available data sets is considered an integral part of the project. The main langage used for developments is going to be R (http://www.r-project.org). The illustrations are going to be generated with the Babel extension (http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/) of emacs' (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) org-mode (http://orgmode.org).
